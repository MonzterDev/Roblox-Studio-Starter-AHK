# Roblox-Studio-Starter-AHK
 This is a simple Autohotkey script which allows you to start testing your Roblox Studio game from anywhere. Personally, I use this to test my game without having to leave the Visual Studio Code editor.

This script was created using [Autohotkey v2.0.](https://www.autohotkey.com)

## Note

The pre-defined hotkeys in our script are `F5` (Start) and `F6` (Stop). By default, Roblox Studio uses `F5` to start and `Shift + F5` to stop. I was unable to get `Shift + F5` to work, so I just went with `F6` instead. This means if you're using the executable, you will need to change the Stop hotkey inside of Roblox Studio to `F6`.

1. Open Roblox Studio.
2. Go to `File > Advanced > Customize Shortcuts...`
3. Find the `Stop` shortcut and add `F6` to it.

## How to use

There are two ways of using this script.

### Executable

The advantage to using the executable is that you don't need to install Autohotkey.

The executable (.exe file) is a compiled version of the script. So you can just run the file and then use the pre-defined hotkeys to start and stop Roblox Studio.

Once you've ran the executable, you can use the pre-defined hotkeys to start and stop Roblox Studio.

### Source Code

The advantage to using the source code is that you can edit the hotkeys to your liking.

1. Download [Autohotkey v2.0.](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe)
2. Download the RobloxStudio.ahk file.
3. Run the Autohotkey script by double clicking it.
4. Once the script is running, you can use the pre-defined hotkeys to start and stop Roblox Studio.
